# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

## Critical: Foundry VTT Module Validation

**Every implementation must validate that all files referenced in `module.json` exist and are properly built:**

- [ ] **Check `esmodules` entries** (e.g., `ds-reskinner.mjs`) are generated by build process
- [ ] **Check `styles` entries** (e.g., `css/module.css`) are available  
- [ ] **Check `templates` entries** exist in correct directory structure
- [ ] **Check `languages` entries** exist and are properly formatted
- [ ] **Run build process**: `npm run build` to generate required files
- [ ] **Validate file paths**: Ensure all paths in `module.json` match actual file locations
- [ ] **Test module loading**: Verify Foundry VTT can load the module without metadata validation errors

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **Missing `ds-reskinner.mjs`** → Run `npm run build` 
- **Build tool dependency conflicts** → Check `package.json` and fix incompatible versions
- **Missing CSS/Template files** → Verify rollup copy configuration
- **Path misalignment** → Update module.json to match generated file structure

**Learned from Experience**: The error `"Metadata validation failed for module "ds-reskinner": The file "ds-reskinner.mjs" included by module ds-reskinner does not exist"` occurred because the build process wasn't run to generate the bundled JavaScript file that Foundry VTT expects.
