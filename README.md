# Draw Steel Reskinner
Draw Steel rules provide guidance on how to reskin a monster and so I created a this app to do just that.

## Features
- Reskinner launched by right clicking on a monster in either the actor list or compendium

- Saved as a new actor.
- Swap name
- Swap image
  - Right now the image is changing both the character art and token. I could split this.
- Swap one damage type for another (global find and replace)
  - Only does 1 for now, might add more.
- Swap one condition for another
  - Again, might add option for more than 1. 
- Movement type addition / removal
- Change level & Role
  - I put some restrictions on Role changes. So a leader an solo can only swap between them and the others can't become one (because you'd have to add villan actions)



## Future item
- more damage swaps
- Find and replace more items
- break out images
